### This repository contains codes which:
- re-implement StyleGAN in PyTorch with progressive growing training, truncation layers, loss function with R1 penalty, etc;
- progressively train StyleGAN on landscape photos;
- classify in the disentangled latent space;
- display the results with Dash and deploy the codes on Heroku platform.
