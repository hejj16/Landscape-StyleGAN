![image](https://github.com/hejj16/Landscape-StyleGAN/blob/main/result.png)
 <br />Uncurated set of images producted by the generator. **Generate your own landscape photos [here](https://taking-non-existing-photos.herokuapp.com/)!**

### This repository contains codes which:
- re-implement StyleGAN in PyTorch;
- progressively train StyleGAN on landscape photos;
- classify photos by time and weather in the disentangled latent space;
- display the results with Dash and deploy the model on Heroku platform.



 with progressive growing training, truncation layers, loss function with R1 penalty, etc
