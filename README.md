## ***......Being Updated......***



![image](https://github.com/hejj16/Landscape-StyleGAN/blob/main/result.png)
 <br />Uncurated set of images producted by the generator.
 

### This repository contains codes which:
- re-implement StyleGAN in PyTorch with progressive growing training, truncation layers, loss function with R1 penalty, etc;
- progressively train StyleGAN on landscape photos([notebook for training]());
- classify in the disentangled latent space;
- deploy the model and display on [this app](https://taking-non-existing-photos.herokuapp.com/).
